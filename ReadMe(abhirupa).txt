Idea: I have tried designing the frontend interface for an organization which helps analyzes the web traffic and brings
out analytical statistics for its clients(corporate organizations.)

New Implementations:

I have tried using modals for the login and sign up links.
I have used a carousal to increase the appeal of the site.
